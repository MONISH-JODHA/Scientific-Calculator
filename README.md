A replica of Google's Scientific Calculator built live which is :-

This scientific calculator is designed to perform a wide range of mathematical calculations and functions. It is commonly used in scientific, engineering, and mathematical fields where complex calculations are required. 

Here are some key features and functions typically found in my scientific calculator:

1. Display: Scientific calculators usually have a large, multi-line display it can show both input expressions and the resulting calculations.

2. Arithmetic Operations: It can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These calculators often support the use of parentheses to prioritize calculations.

3. Trigonometric Functions: It includes trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, and their inverses (arcsine, arccosine, arctangent). These functions are commonly used in geometry and trigonometry.

4. Exponents and Roots: Scientific calculators can handle calculations involving exponents (raising a number to a power) and roots (taking the square root, cube root, etc.). It often has dedicated keys for square (x²) and cube (x³) functions.

5. Logarithmic Functions: Logarithmic functions, including logarithms (log) and natural logarithms (ln), are available on scientific calculators. These functions are useful in various mathematical and scientific applications.

6. Hyperbolic Functions: This Scientific calculator provide hyperbolic functions such as hyperbolic sine (sinh), hyperbolic cosine (cosh), and hyperbolic tangent (tanh). These functions are commonly used in calculus and physics.

7. Complex Numbers: It can handle calculations involving complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers. 

It's important to note that scientific calculators can vary in terms of features and capabilities. Different models may have additional functions or specialized features based on specific fields or requirements.
